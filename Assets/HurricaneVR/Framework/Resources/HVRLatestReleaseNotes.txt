Release 2.0.2
-Fixed Gun Creator Editor not setting magazine grag / hover eject colliders as a trigger
-Fixed Gun Creator to add the eject direction transform and link to magazine socket field for eject animation direction
-Fixed Bullet Trail Line Renderer to be behind and not in front of the transform

Release 2.0.1

Fixed up Pump Shotgun prefab to behave a little more like a shotgun when it comes to ejecting shells
Fixed an issue with the door where it wouldn't require handle rotation after being unlocked the first time

TechDemo Scene Updated with UI for Locomotion Options and Sit / Stand and Height Calibration demonstration
SteamVRController now use haptics action for playing haptics instead of legacy XR which might not work in build mode for steam devices.

New Sitting / Standing Mode Enhancements	
HVRCameraRig:
	-CameraScale : Transform field for scaling when in Standing Mode, the camera and tracked controller transforms should become a child of this transform
	-PlayerHeight : The height of the virtual player to base camera offsets and scaling from
	-SitStanding : Enum with 3 modes
		Sitting: Height Calibration will boost the Camera to this height
		Standing: Height Calibration will scale the 'CameraScale' transform based on the 'PlayerHeight' and Camera Height at time of calibration.
		PlayerHeight: will behave has normal with no scaling or camera offsetting.
	
		
Rig prefabs updated with CameraScale transform setup

Release 2.0

Fixes:
-Hands should no longer try to reach world 0,0,0 upon start, which might happen the further the player starts from 0,0,0
-HVRDestroyListener component that is added to a grab point on grab should now be properly destroyed upon release
-Hot fix for a interpolation bug in Unity where parenting a kinematic rigidbody with interpolate on would cause the object to not follow the parent accurately
-Fixed a bug in the hexabody physics hand integration where grabbing the same climbable object with both hands and then releasing one would reset the hand strength
	when the climbing hand strength should remain active while held.
-Fixed and issue where buttons on scroll view could not be clicked when using the included UI Input Module.
-SFXPlayer : no longer changes the name of the pooled audio source to the sfx clip it's playing by default as using gameobject.name allocates garbage.
-HVRTriggerGrabbableBag : updated to use TryGetComponent to reduce garbage allocation while in editor mode.
-HVRGrabbableBag: no longer listens for grabbable destroy events to save unnessecary garbage allocation.
-TeleportMarker fbx moved from samples to framework/models, prefab updated to use new fbx file
-Teleport laser line should not long jitter

New Escape Room style Tech Demo Scene included with all new models, textures, and sfx that you can use in your games if you wish.

-Socket examples with events
-Joint rotation limiter > 180 degrees example 


New Gun Components:
-The old gun components are now deprecated and will no longer receive updates and will be removed in a future update. 	

HVRGunBase: new base component for guns to derive from.
HVRCockingHandle: handles reciprocating, non reciprocating, and pump shotgun style cocking handles.
HVRAutoDropMagazine: HVRSocket extension used to remove magazine from the gun when a new magazine is near.
HVRGrabMagazine: dummy grabbable used to grab a magazine from a gun cleanly, helpful to give non input options to remove a magazine.
HVRMagazineSocket: specialized socket used to animate the loading and ejection of magazines.
HVRGunEmmiterBase : new base component for emitting bullets and casings
HVRPooledEmitter: Object pool emitter for bullets and casings
HVRShotgun : new class for new gun system
HVRBulletEmitter: emits bullet prefabs that remain in the world
HVRTriggerAnimator : animates the trigger based on trigger pull amount
HVRGunBolt : animated gun part 

New Gun Editor Window:
New Editor window that will take a template gun prefab and create all of the necessary objects and components and link them together for you.

New Components:
HVRRigidbodyLocker: helps lock joints into position and rotation on locked axis
HVRRotationSFX:	can use HVRRotationTracker to play sfx based on angle changes


	
Teleporting Updates: (Default Rig prefabs updated) Users that modified the teleport will need to revisit and setup the teleport marker.
-HVRTeleporter re-written with subclassing in mind.
-New Bezier Line Curve option
-Max teleport angle option to limit height
-Optional Destination line of sight checks
-Optional line of sight to teleport line origin check
-Optional drop distance check
-Optional jump distance check
-TeleportableLayers field to define layers that you can teleport onto
-Valid / Invalid colors of the line renderer now set in the inspector
-Capsule field added for non character controller based checks.
-Added HVRTeleportMarkerBase and HVRTeleportMarker components for custom destination markers.
-Added HVRInvalidTeleport component that can be added to gameobjects to disallow teleporting 

-HVRPlayerController added 'DirectionStyle' to control the player direction with Camera, LeftController, or RightController
-HVRHandPoser: animation parameter changed to text field instead of drop down populated from HVRSettings
-HVRPhysicsDoor: added sfx for closing and opening
-HVRPhysicsDrawer : added sfx for closing and opening
-HVRHandGrabber : default throw bonus factor set to 0 from 1
-HVRGrabbable : default angular to linear throw factor set to 0 from 1

Layers:
LeftTarget and RightTarget have been collapsed into a single layer 'DynamicPose', the position of this layer does not matter, nor does it require any
	consideration in the collision matrix or for line of sight checks. 
	Be sure to add this layer after updating. The layer setup helper tool will replace this for you. 
	The layer helper tool will now pop up a message box with a report of the layer setup process.

Release 1.99

-HVRGrabbable - removed scale warning for now.
-HVRGlobal prefab updated with required components, including SFXPlayer, updated main examples scenes to use it (not integration packages).

-HVRSocket 
	- set grabbable local offsets a frame after when using RemoveRigidbody socketing as the rigidbody might move one more time this cycle.
	- 'RemoveRigidbody' mode no longer requires the socket to have a rigidbody

-HVRPosableGrabPoint 
	-JointOffset Renamed to HandRotationOffset. This rotation offset will no longer be applied to the hand to object joint, but will instead offset		
		the controller tracking target when this grab point is held. Existing users of this field will probably need to adjust their offsets.
	-Added HandPositionOffset - positional offset to apply to the controller tracking when held.
	
-HVRHandgrabber - added ControllerOffset field (HVRControllerOffset), auto populated from the 'TrackedController' field if that is populated.
-HVRControllerOffset 
	- updated to manage the additional offsets provided by grab points.
	- Added SetMiscPositionOffset(position, rotation) method which will let you further offset the controller tracking at runtime if desired.


Release 1.98

-Fixed "full" log spam when releasing objects
-Fixed an issue where grabbable rigidbody collision detection mode would not revert to pre grab state if the object was grabbed within 10 seconds of release
-Fixed an issue where HVRPlayerController - MovementEnabled set to false would prevent gravity from taking affect.

-HVRTimeManager will no longer set all rigidbodies in the scene to interpolate when time step smoothing is disabled.
-HVRGrabbable Rigidbody property is made public
-HVRStabber - added ForceUnstab method.
-HVRStabber - added 'IgnoreVelocityCheck' field. If true will ignore stabbable velocity requirement for stab entry.
-HVRPlayerController - CameraRig XZ now offset by the initial HMD position on start to keep the player in it's intended position
-HVRPlayerController - Climbing movement is now clamped to max distance of either left or right hand when two handed climbing.

-HVRSocketContainer - virtualized methods
-HVRHandAnimator - added FingerCurlsSource public property to set the source of finger tracking values. Useful for users wanting to sync in multiplayer.
-HVRGrabbable - logs warning on awake when the object is not of 1,1,1 scale which is required for the grab system to work correctly.

Release 1.97

-Fixed Hand Pose Editor from resetting hand poses on object selection due to a change Unity made to their object field change events in 2020+ 
-Fixed an issue where grabbing a rigidbody with rotation constraints enabled would cause a inertia tensor 0 error on second release of the object.

-HVRHandGrabber GrabTrigger now supports "Manual Release" in addition to Active and Toggle holds. The held object will not be dropped until	
	the ForceRelease method is called on the grabbable or the hand component.
-HVRHandGrabber - IK auto pose can now grab static grabbables without a rigidbody.
-HVRSocketBag now has "IgnoreSockets" list and IgnoreSocket(HVRSocket) method to ignore specific sockets (useful to ignore sockets on the hand / wrist area)
-HVRHandGrabOnStart - new component to force a hand grabber to grab a specific grabbable after start.
-HVRSocketable - added LinkedGrabbables for compound objects, if any linked grabbable is being held, the object cannot be socketed.
-Bow prefab updated with an additional grab point with the hand in 180 degrees opposite orientation
-HVRGrabbable - Added HandFullReleased event which executes when a hand released it and it is no longer being held after.
-HVRGrabbable - Added DisableHandCollision field to HVRGrabbable, if true the hand holding this object will have it's collision disabled while held.

Release 1.96

-Fixed VRIK Tutorial Link
-Fixed OpenXR controller detection for old WMR devices
-Fixed XRPluginManagement compile error in HVRInputManager when using XRPlugin version < 4
-Fixed an issue with the physics bow shooting direction because it shoots in the next frame after destroying the arrow joint.
-Fixed linked sockets from playing their grabbed SFX
-Fixed an issue where having multiple inspectors open with HVRPosableHand would cause the selected pose to pose the hand.
-HVRPosableHand : added "Preview Selected" button (with undo support) which will pose the hand with the pose in the Selected Pose field. 
	The hand will no longer immediately pose on Selected Pose field changed to prevent accidently ruining
	hand posing if the user clicks on the hand preview when multiple inspectors are open.
-Added OpenXR controller detection for hp reverb g2
-Reduced default collision ignore on grabbable release from 5s to .5s

Concave Collider Grabbable:
	-Grab Detection ignores max distance check
	-Auto pose will ray cast from palm forward, if nothing is hit then the palm position is used so the grab won't fail
	-HVRHandGrabber will not use line of sight checks


Release 1.95
Fixes:
-Fixed HVRTriggerGrabbableBag not removing grabbables when using HVRSettings(UseAttachedRigidBody / ComponentInParentFallback)
-sockets whose objects aren't allowed to be removed by the hand will no longer cause another socket to be unhovered 
	(example: holstered pistol with a mag socket holding a magazine)
-Fixed editor build error introduced in 1.94 in HVRSettings
-Fixed an issue where grabs might not execute when update and fixed update are out of sync

Grab Detection Updates:
-Grab Input Checks moved to Update
-Line of sight checks that might fail because the ray origin is inside a collider will try and detect this case and return true
-Added support for non convex meshes in the grab detection system (could be useful for climbing the environment)
-HVRGrabbable : Add 'UseColliderClosestPoint' (Default true), used by line of sight and grabbable detection distance check
-Line of sight check updated to ray cast at the collider closest point instead of collider bounds if grabbable
	 doesn't have concave colliders. Concave colliders will aim at the collider bound center.
	 Should help with distance grabbing objects with larger colliders.
-HVRGrabbable : Added 'GrabColliders', if populated only these colliders will be used to detect a grab.

HVRCollisionEvents : Added ImpulseOrVelocity option that triggers the threshold met event.
HVRHandAnimator : now updates poses in LateUpdate instead of Update
HVRHandGrabber : updates physics pose in LateUpdate
HVRRayCastGun : added 'Hit' event
HVRCameraRig : organized the inspector fields and added tooltips, set CameraYOffset default to 0
